    [ NOTE ]: EWCreditClock suit version Chronos introduces the concept of
              Master User Accounts. On user action AcquireMasterAccess, the
              CToken is linked to the Master Account and reported as acquired.

    [ NOTE ]: The Master Account class ResMaster inherits from subordonate
              account class ResUser.

    [ NOTE ]: The introduction of Master User Accounts comes with the following
              implications:

        * System actions SweepCleanupCToken and TargetCleanupCToken require
          refactoring to release any acquired Master accounts.

        * All subordonate account actions need refactoring to honour imposed
          Master oriented restrictions.

        * CToken requires refactoring to adjust to linked Master Account.

        * All EWSC and EWCC functional tests require refactoring to acquire
          default Master account (S:CoreMaster).

        * EWSessionManager setup procedure requires refactoring to create
          S:CoreMaster account.

        * The following client actions are required:
            . NewMasterAccount {
                controller: client,
                ctype: action,
                action: new,
                new: master,
                master: account,
                client_id: <ctoken-label>,
                session_token: <stoken-label>,
                user_email: <email-address>,
                user_pass: <password>,
            }
            . AcquireMaster {
                controller: client,
                ctype: action,
                action: acquire,
                acquire: master,
                client_id: <ctoken-label>,
                session_token: <stoken-label>,
                master: <email-address>,
                key: <master-key-code>,
            }
            . ReleaseMaster

        * The following system actions are required:
            . TargetCleanupMaster
            . FreezeMaster
            . UnfreezeMaster
            . IncreaseMasterSubPool
            . DecreaseMasterSubPool

        * The following master actions are required:
            . AccountLogin
            . AccountLogout
            . ViewAccount
            . EditAccount
            . UnlinkAccount
            . InspectCTokens
            . InspectSubPool
            . InspectSub
